## Authentication Guide

Some endpoints require authentication. Here's how to authenticate:
1. Access Token (Bearer Token)

Used for most user-authenticated actions.

Header Example:

Authorization: Bearer <access_token>

    Get your access token by logging in (POST /api/login).

    Include it in the Authorization header for protected endpoints like deleting chirps or updating your profile.

2. Refresh Token

Used to refresh your access token (POST /api/refresh) or revoke it (POST /api/revoke).

Header Example:

Authorization: Bearer <refresh_token>

    Treat refresh tokens like access tokens but only use them for refresh/revoke endpoints.

    They usually have longer expiration times.

3. Polka API Key

Used by external services to trigger upgrades (like Chirpy Red subscriptions).

Header Example:

Authorization: ApiKey <your_polka_api_key>

    Only the /api/upgrade endpoint expects this format.

    This is not a user token â€” it's a special secret given to trusted third parties.
